                I am a nerd. I like to repair and tinker with old electronics, and I enjoy programming.

                    Why did I choose MSITERPUG51?
                </b>
                <br>
                I chose MISTERPUG51 as my Scratch username in 2018. At the time, I thought pugs were cute (I no longer do) and I thought it sounded cool (it doesn't). Ever since then, I've used that username.
