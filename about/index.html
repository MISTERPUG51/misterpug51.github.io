            Who am I?
        </b>
        <p>
        I am a nerd. I like to repair and tinker with old electronics, and I enjoy programming.

            Why did I choose MSITERPUG51?
        </b>
        <p>
            I chose MISTERPUG51 as my Scratch username in 2018. At the time, I thought pugs were cute (I no longer do) and I thought it sounded cool (it doesn't). Ever since then, I've used that username.
